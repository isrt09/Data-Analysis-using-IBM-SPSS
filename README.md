# Data Analysis using IBM SPSS v25

I am following some techniques in that used in IBM SPSS.
The major data analysis are quantitative research instead of qualiatative research.
The core part of analysis is that Regression Analysis and so on. For example,

    - Simple   Linear Regression
    - Multiple Linear Regression
    - Binomial / Binary Logic / Logistic Regression
    - Hierarchical Multiple Regression
    - Multinomial Regression.
    - Regression with Dummy Variables
    - Ordinal Regression
    - Polynomial Regression

This will be also implemented as Data Science domain i.e Machine Learning Technologies. 
That's Advanced Data Science technologies using IBM SPSS by Dr. Bogdan Anastasiei
